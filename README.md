## Projects

Below is a list of my machine learning projects, each with a brief description and a link to the Google Colab notebook for detailed code and analysis:

- **[House Price Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JMHEYn7tvwMMJwk4YUfWatTLFZV9uUCP)**  
  Developed a regression model to estimate housing prices based on features like location, size, and amenities.

- **[Car Price Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1RYlGHMR5UdyiCT3ZwJRkeCSwFWtxx-a8)**  
  Built a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of cars using dataset attributes such as make, model, and mileage.

- **[Movie Recommender System](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12uIAqURpqhbQf8hkJkT70JBfMQx-LiGn)**  
  Created a recommendation engine using collaborative filtering to suggest movies based on user preferences.

- **[Fake News Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1p4XjhVehdX3zsqhA83IVSbjueFJqK8cl)**  
  Applied classification models to detect and filter misleading or fake news articles with high accuracy.

- **[Red Wine Quality Prediction](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/15813di_VrSK-F4LCpPivUOWuZqiLr1U7)**  
  Developed a supervised learning model to predict wine quality based on chemical properties like acidity and alcohol content.

- **[Rock vs Mine Detection](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1T1Q6UpMU-4OxPqL9bMm94wJbldqjpG_G)**
